#### The first column of data provides the amount of milk consumed in ounces. The second column describes the following diaper change and its contents.
```{r echo=FALSE}
bottles_diapers
```
#### Summary analysis of the dataset
``` {r echo=FALSE}
summary(bottles_diapers)
oz_milk = bottles_diapers[3:12,1]
oz = as.numeric(oz_milk)+2
```
#### Calculated mean of ounces drank by Woody
```{r echo=FALSE}
