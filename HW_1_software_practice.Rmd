### Homework # 1 Software Practice

The goal of this homework is: 

-  Demonstrate that you have R and RStudio successfully installed on your computer
-  You can create an RMarkdown document 
-  You can interact with the class GitHub page

***

Create your own dataset about something in your life right now. I'm looking for at least 10 observations of at least 2 variables. Bonus points if you use this to entertain me or teach me something about yourself. 

Here are some examples:

-  The title, genre and number of pages in your 10 favorite books
-  The number of squirrels you can see outside of your window every hour on the hour along with a 1-word description of the weather (i.e. "sunny", "drizzly", "foggy")
-  The calories, protein and salt content of the last 10 snacks you ate
-  The number of coins and mushrooms you collect in each of 10 levels when you replay Super Mario Brothers on SNES over the weekend
-  The number of letters and the "severity index" (haha) of the last 10 curse-words you said while working on your research

This should be fun and shouldn't take much time. For more inspiration, you can look at the Dear Data project: http://www.dear-data.com/theproject

Create an RMarkdown file (.Rmd) in RStudio. You can either record your data into a spread sheet and read it into your `.Rmd` file using `read.csv()` or you can just manually enter your data into a data.frame in an R code chunk. If you put the data into a separate file to read in, store that file in the `data/` directory provided in the repository. 

Explain the data that you collected. Why did you choose to collect this data? What does each variable mean? Insert a code chunk in the RMarkdown document where you print your data.frame with the `print()` function, show me the `summary()` output and if you have any numeric variables, calculate their `mean()`.

Make sure the `title`, `author` and `date` parameters are correct in the RMarkdown YAML at the top of the file. Please save your `.Rmd` file with the name `HW_1_your_last_name.Rmd`. Commit, pull and push all of the changes to your private homework repository back onto GitHub for me to grade. If you loaded your data in from a separate file, make sure you push this file as well.
